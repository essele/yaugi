# YAUGI -- Yet Another USB GPIB Interface

## Disclaimer

This is an experimental device and experimental code, it has not been 
fully tested and may damage your equipment. Please do not attempt to
use this device and code unless you know what you are doing.

I can accept no liability whatsoever for any damage caused.

## Introduction

Details to follow ... however:

The PCB KiCAD files are in the KiCAD directory

The code, which is a PSoC Creator project is in the "GPIB USB Adapter" directory.

This is work in progress and will be documented over time.

## Errata

The PCB is a test board and as such has a number of issues, most notibly:

- the shield of the IEE488 connector is not connected to the USB shield
- the IEE488 connector needs to be populated on the back of the board

The code is absoultely work-in-progress so lots of things won't work and
this will change over time.
